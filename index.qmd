Hey there!
My name is Liam and Iâ€™m a recent graduate from Middlebury College with a B.A. in geography and mathematics.
I currently work as a Data Science Intern at the [Rocky Mountain Inventory & Monitoring Network](https://www.nps.gov/im/romn/index.htm), where I develop code to manage long term ecological monitoring data.
Other professional interests include remote sensing, cartography, conservation, and sustainability.

I grew up in Rochester, NY with my four siblings, parents, and grandma, and I'm currently working remotely from Middlebury, VT.
When I'm not at work or spending time with family, you can find me rock climbing, standing on my hands, or playing piano.

This website serves as my digital portfolio, displaying the products of my education and work experience.
To get in touch, please drop me a line at [1liam1smith1@gmail.com](mailto: 1liam1smith1@gmail.com).
