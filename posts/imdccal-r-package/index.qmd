As part of my work at the Rocky Mountain Inventory & Monitoring Network, I contributed to this R package to streamline water chemistry data processing for users across the National Park Service.
Specifically, I added functions to help users format data from [Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (CCAL)](https://ccal.oregonstate.edu/) into the EQuIS Electronic Data Deliverable format and wrote unit tests to ensure the validity of my contributions.
