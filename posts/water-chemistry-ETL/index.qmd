During my internship with the Rocky Mountain Inventory & Monitoring Network, I revamped a preexisting Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process by implementing new quality control procedures and
migrating the codebase from Visual Basic to R.
In addition to writing quality control functions to improve the quality of our data, I achieved a 90% reduction in code volume (17,000+ to under 2,000 lines), reducing future maintenance effort.

I delivered a capstone presentation about this project at the Inventory & Monitoring Division's data management Fireside Chat, and I published my code online at the following GitHub repository.
