## Abstract

This analysis assessed the extent to which residences in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, would lose access to food sources in the case of a severe flooding event.
Specifically, I conducted a distance analysis on PostGIS to determine how much the distance from every residence in Dar Es Salaam to the nearest grocery vendor would increase between an everyday scenario and a severe flood scenario.
The results revealed that flooding has minimal impact on food accessibility, except for in a few small regions.
Of the 1,292,622 residences in Dar Es Salaam, only 1,317 of them would be over 500 meters further from a non-flooded grocery vendor in the event of severe flooding.

### Keywords

Dar Es Salaam, food security, distance, flood, vulnerability

## Study design

The following analysis is an exploratory study addressing the impacts of extreme flooding on food accessibility in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.

The spatial extent of the study is the city of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
The **spatial scale / support** of the study is... (???)
The analysis was conducted based on flood projections and Open Street Map data as of October, 2021.
Thus, the temporal extent of the study is limited to 2021 and a few successive years, but this analysis ought to be updated in following years.
The **temporal support** of the study is... (???)

## Materials and procedure

### Data and variables

[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/-6.8160/39.1601) is a worldwide open source mapping project, which served as the source of the planet_osm_point and planet_osm_polygon layers used in this analysis.

[Resilience Academy](https://resilienceacademy.ac.tz/) 
Describe the **data sources** and **variables** to be used.

### Geographic characteristics

Describe the **temporal** and **geographic characteristics** of the study, including its **temporal extent**, **temporal granularity**, **coordinate reference systems** and **spatial extent**. Are there any **edge effects** or complications from integrating data with different **spatial supports** or **resolutions**?

### Data transformations

Describe any **geographic** or **variable** transformations to be applied to data prior to the main analysis (preprocessing steps required to prepare the data for analysis). If any challenges with edge effects or conflicting spatial supports were identified above, enumerate steps to resolve the issues here.

If any data is to be **excluded** from the analysis, explain the rationale and methods for exclusion.

### Analysis

Describe the main analysis of the study, e.g. the steps for testing the hypotheses or answering the main research questions.

## Results

Objectively present the results of the study without additional interpretation.

## Discussion

Provide a summary the key findings of the study along with any limitations or areas in need of further investigation. If the study did not succeed as expected, discuss likely practical procedural and informative causes. Practical procedural causes relate to problems in the research procedures, e.g. challenges with data, code, or research parameters. Informative causes relate to problems with the referent geographic phenomena, e.g. absence of the theorized effect(s), change in population, or change in location.

I think I will include [my map](index.html) either here or in the results.

## Conclusions

What are the broader implications of the research results for the environment or society? Do the results suggest the need for future research?
