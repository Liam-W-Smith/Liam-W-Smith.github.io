| Hey! My name is Liam and I'm a senior at Middlebury College studying geography and mathematics. If you're interested in seeing my remote sensing work, please [click here](https://sites.middlebury.edu/lwsmithremotesensing/) | ![<img src="(assets/Profile_Photo.jpg" width="500"/>](assets/Profile_Photo.jpg) |

## Research
This past summer, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Joe Holler at Middlebury College.
In this position, I checked the validity of a published study on social vulnerability to natural disasters by coding their entire analysis in Python.
As a part of my work, I programmed Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation from scratch and critiqued the statistical methodology of the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI).
My research advisor and I wrote [this report on our work](RPr-Spielman-2020-report.pdf), which we will present at the American Association of Geographers Annual Meeting in April 2024. 

## Mathematics
At Middlebury, all mathematics majors are required to write a capstone thesis on a topic of interest.
I chose to investigate two applications of spectral graph theory, applying my knowledge of linear algebra to graph theoretic problems.
My senior thesis is [available here](thesis.pdf).

## Open Source GIS

This section documents the work I've done in [GEOG 323: Open Source GIScience](https://gis4dev.github.io/).
