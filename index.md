| Hey! My name is Liam and I’m a senior at Middlebury College studying geography and mathematics. When I’m not at school, I live in Rochester, New York with my four siblings, parents, and grandma. I love hiking, rock climbing, and gymnastics, and I’m passionate about the applications of GIS towards conservation, urban planning, and renewable energy. This website serves as a portfolio for my college education and relevant work experiences. | ![<img src="(assets/Profile_Photo.jpg" width="500"/>](assets/Profile_Photo.jpg) |

## Research
This past summer, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Joe Holler at Middlebury College.
In this position, I checked the validity of a published study on social vulnerability to natural disasters by coding their entire analysis in Python.
As a part of my work, I programmed Principal Component Analysis with varimax rotation from scratch and critiqued the statistical methodology of the Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI).
My research advisor and I wrote [this report on our work](RPr-Spielman-2020-report.pdf), which we will present at the American Association of Geographers Annual Meeting in April 2024. 

## Mathematics

At Middlebury, all mathematics majors are required to write a capstone thesis on a topic of interest.
I chose to investigate two applications of spectral graph theory, applying my knowledge of linear algebra to graph theoretic problems.
My senior thesis is [available here](thesis.pdf).

## Remote Sensing

In my remote sensing class, we practiced the fundamentals of image processing in Google Earth Engine, learned more advanced topics like clustering and classification, and touched on other topics like drone imagery acquisition and image processing in ArcGIS Pro.
