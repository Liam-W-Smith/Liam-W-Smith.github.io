About 1 paragraph:

I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:
![Figure 6.1](assets/figure.png)

- What figure 6.1 says

Figure 6.1 illustrates the steps of abstraction from real world to GIS analysis.
According to this figure, there are three filters which can distort reality and generate error.
The first filter occurs when one perceives a geographic reality.
Our predispositions and biases affect the way we perceive the world, and our conception of the world has downstream effects on our GIS model.
The second filter occurs when we measure and represent a geographic phenomenon, which, of course, depends on our conception of that phenomenon.
Error in measurement and failure to collect the right measurements will also impact the accuracy of our GIS analysis.

There are no natural units of geographic analysis, so the units we use to conduct our studies are entirely subjective.
Vagueness: We often aggregate individual measurements into polygon layers, abstracting reality and generalizing measurements.
Ambiguity: We often use indirect indicators as proxies for something we're interested in (measurement)
We make mistakes when collecting data.
Vector model might not be as accurate as a raster model in mapping fine details from a macro view, but at the same time, rasters may include "mixels", which are a mix of two measurements instead of a clearly dilineated one.
modifiable aerial unit problem
We often find error in locations, boundaries, and classifications of zones.



The third filter in figure 6.1 occurs when one analyzes their data
"Relationships typically grow stronger when based on larger grographic units."
Manipulating erroneous data within a GIS propogates these errors.


The limited tools we use and the skill (or lake thereof) with which we use them will also introduce error into our models.
At the conclusion of the process, our uncertainty must encompass all of the imperfections found our conception, measurement, and analysis of the world.
Our conception dictates our measurement, our measurement dictates our analysis, and every step of the process is an opportunity to introduce additional uncertainty.

 - my interpretation of figure 6.1

- Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
Yes. All GIS includes uncertainty, because all representations of the world are inherently incomplete.
Uncertainty = problems that arise out of imperfect models
Error = "differences between observers or between mesaureing instruments"
Accuracy = "difference between reality and our representation of reality"


- What responsibilities do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
Geographers are responsible for acknowledging and reducing uncertainty in their work.
They are also responsible for using data that is reliable.

- What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?
First and foremost, geographers ought to acknowledge the uncertainty inherent to any published work, pointing readers to some of the likely sources of inaccuracy.
Additionally, geographers should be prudent in their statistical analysis of their work and should report on any relevant uncertainty statistics.
Finally, they should do their due diligence when obtaining data sources; this means evaluating the methods with which data was collected, obtaining information regarding the quality of the data, and ensuring that the data source is trustworthy.
It is also critical to generate and report information regarding the impacts that input uncertainty might have on the output.
And using multiple sources of data tends to reduce the uncertainty that analysis would have if one used just one source of data.
