About 1 paragraph:

I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:

- What figure 6.1 says & my interpretation:
Figure 6.1 illustrates

![Figure 6.1](Figure-6.1.png)


- Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
Yes. All GIS includes uncertainty, because all representations of the world are inherently incomplete.
Uncertainty = problems that arise out of imperfect models
Error = "differences between observers or between mesaureing instruments"
Accuracy = "difference between reality and our representation of reality"


- What responsibilities do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?

- What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?
