Chakraborty only included the relative risk for the center county of each cluster.
We calculate the relative risk for each county.
It might be better to have one risk score for the entire cluster. Keyword: might. We would have to try it.


Note that the coefficients and p-values are all small. We are working with a massive dataset, so even though the variables have just a small impact on the prevalence of COVID-19, we find significant levels in our p-values. In massive datasets we can almost always find something that is significant.
